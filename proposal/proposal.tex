\textbf{\underline{1st Paragraph:}} 

\textbf{Identify a published fMRI paper and the accompanying data
\cite{lindquist2008statistical}.  You should explain the basic idea of the
paper in a paragraph. You should also perform basic sanity check on the data
(e.g., can you downloaded, can you load the files, confirm that you have the
correct number of subjects).}\\

The paper, \textbf{\emph{Distributed and Overlapping Representations of Faces
and Objects in Ventral Temporal Cortex}}\cite{object_rec_main}, collected data 
from a sample of six subjects of which consists of five females and one male. It 
presented eight categories of stimuli, faces, houses, chairs, animals, shoes, 
bottles, tools, and control (phase-scrambled images), to each subject, and 
wanted to answer the question: if we present different categories of picture 
stimulus to a subject, whether each stimulus category would evoke the same of 
category-specific pattern of response in the ventral object vision pathway, and 
whether we could distinguish individual categories from the patterns of response 
evoked. Each subject were placed into the functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) for 12 times thus generating 12 time series data. For each time of scanning, 
it began with 12 seconds of rest, followed by eight stimulus blocks of 24-s 
duration, one for each category and separated by 12-s intervals of rest, and 
ended the procedure with another 12 seconds of rest. During each 24-s stimulus 
blocks, stimuli were presented for 500 ms followed by an interstimulus interval 
for 1500 ms, thus presented a total of 12 stimuli during each stimulus block 
and 96 stimuli in a complete experiment run.

The data collected for each subject were split into two sets: odd runs and even 
runs. Correlation were used as indices of response similarity, and from 
analyzing within-category correlation and between-category correlation, the 
result suggested that category-specific patterns of response were distributed 
and overlapping. The result brought a new question of whether each stimulus 
category evoked a distinct pattern of response in cortex that responded 
maximally to other categories. To test whether the patterns of non-maximal 
responses carry category-related information, voxels that responded maximally 
to either category were excluded from calculation of correlations. It turned 
out that removal of maximally responded voxels from correlation calculation 
barely diminished the accuracy of identification. The research reached a 
conclusion that the pattern of large and small responses, not just the location 
of large responses, carry category-related information, and small responses 
are an integral part of the representation.\\

\textbf{\underline{2nd Paragraph:}} \\
\textbf{Briefly explain what approach you intend to take for exploring
the data and paper.  If you intend to ``reproduce'' some aspect of the paper,
explain in exactly what sense you mean to do this.  If you are thinking about
validating the data describe the assumpution used in the analysis and indicate
how you might check them.}\\

The approach we are taking to explore the data is as follows. First, we will
pre-process and clean the data in order to produce a dataset for easier
manipulation. Then, we will be conducting statistical analysis to find if there
is interesting correlations among the subjects and their scans. For example,
we can study whether the fMRI pattern for different categories are
significantly different between each other, within individual subjects, and
across different subjects. The Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for this
particular example. In addition, we will utilize machine learning methods to
build models predicting fMRI blood flow, hence determining what objects people
are seeing based on past training data. Some regression techniques that are
available to use for fMRI data include ridge or lasso regression, Principal
Component Analysis, or regression trees.

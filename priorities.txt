1. find axis = 3, all the z values that covers vt cortex
    - for each subject, look through all 2-d x,y cross sections to find the 
      z-values at which the cortex ends (guess it gaga)

2. use z values to select 10 cross sections hights for the subject across all
   12 runs
    - meaning to creat an array of intensities with index of elements 
      to be 2-d position
    i. start from [z=0, z=your selected z-value (of where the cortex ends]. 
       make 10 evenly spaced points, pull out the x,y cross sections. you 
       should have 10 for each subject
       
3. within each of the 12 runs of that subject, use the 10 z-points to create 
10 sets of 40x64 arrays of intensity values

4. within that run, average all 10 arrays to get one averageed array of
intensities, should be 40x64

5.

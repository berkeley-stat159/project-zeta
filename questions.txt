1) The paper states that they looked at the ventral temporal cortex of 
   the brain. When we opened up the .nii files, we found four dimensional 
   data. The data gives 3-D slices of the brain at different time points. 
   We take these 3-D slices and observe a 2-D cross section for a set value 
   of the z-variable. Therefore, we are looking at cross-sections of the 
   brain from above. How do we know which z-value to take the cross-section 
   of? We wish to reproduce the study's results, so we wish to find the 
   z-value that gives us a cross-section at teh ventral temportal cortex. 
   However, how can we find out this z-value?

2) What does the get_data() method actually return? Our values range from
   0 to 2500. Are these intensity values?
